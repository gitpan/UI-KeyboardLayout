Diacritics are small markings which are placed around the IPA letter in order to show a certain alteration or more specific description in the letter's pronunciation.[32] Sub-diacritics (markings normally placed below a letter) may be placed above a letter having a descender (informally called a tail), e.g. ŋ̊, ȷ̈.[32]

The dotless i, ⟨ı⟩, is used when the dot would interfere with the diacritic. Other IPA letters may appear as diacritic variants to represent phonetic detail: tˢ (fricative release), bʱ (breathy voice), ˀa (glottal onset), ᵊ (epenthetic schwa), oʊ (diphthongization). Additional diacritics were introduced in the Extensions to the IPA, which were designed principally for speech pathology.

Notes
    a^ With aspirated voiced consonants, the aspiration is also voiced. Many linguists prefer one of the diacritics dedicated to breathy voice.
    b^ Some linguists restrict this breathy-voice diacritic to sonorants, and transcribe obstruents as bʱ.

The state of the glottis can be finely transcribed with diacritics. A series of alveolar plosives ranging from an open to a closed glottis phonation are:
Open glottis 	[t] 	voiceless
	[d̤] 	breathy voice, also called murmured
	[d̥] 	slack voice
Sweet spot 	[d] 	modal voice
	[d̬] 	stiff voice
	[d̰] 	creaky voice
Closed glottis 	[ʔ͡t] 	glottal closure
[edit] Suprasegmentals

These symbols describe the features of a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of the sounds of a language, as well as the rhythm and intonation of speech.[33] Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word.[33]

Length, stress, and rhythm
ˈa 	Primary stress (symbol goes
before stressed syllable) 	ˌa 	Secondary stress (symbol goes
before stressed syllable)
aː kː 	Long (long vowel or
geminate consonant) 	aˑ 	Half-long
ə̆ 	Extra-short 	a.a 	Syllable break
s‿a 	Linking (absence of a break)
Intonation
| 	Minor (foot) break 	‖ 	Major (intonation) break
↗ 	Global rise 	↘ 	Global fall
Tone diacritics and tone letters
ŋ̋ e̋ 	e˥ 	Extra high / top 	ꜛke 	Upstep
ŋ́ é 	e˦ 	High 	ŋ̌ ě 	Rise
ŋ̄ ē 	e˧ 	Mid 		
ŋ̀ è 	e˨ 	Low 	ŋ̂ ê 	Fall
ŋ̏ ȅ 	e˩ 	Extra low / bottom 	ꜜke 	Downstep

Finer distinctions of tone may be indicated by combining the tone diacritics and letters shown here, though not many fonts support this. The primary examples are high (mid) rising ɔ᷄, ɔ˧˥; low rising ɔ᷅, ɔ˩˧; high falling ɔ᷇, ɔ˥˧; low (mid) falling ɔ᷆, ɔ˧˩; peaking ɔ᷈, ɔ˧˥˧; and dipping ɔ᷉, ɔ˧˩˧. A work-around for diacritics sometimes seen when a language has more than one rising or falling tone, and the author does not wish to completely abandon the IPA, is to restrict generic rising ɔ̌ and falling ɔ̂ for the higher-pitched of the rising and falling tones, ɔ˥˧ and ɔ˧˥, and to use the non-standard subscript diacritics ɔ̗ and ɔ̖ for the lower-pitched rising and falling tones, ɔ˩˧ and ɔ˧˩. When a language has four level tones, the two mid tones are sometimes transcribed as high-mid ɔ̍ (non-standard) and low-mid ɔ̄.
