Run
  perl -I %HOME%/ru-pho-keyboard/UI-KeyboardLayout/lib  -wC31 %HOME%/ru-pho-keyboard/UI-KeyboardLayout/examples/print_nameslist.pl FOO  >FOO-charnamelist
over these files.  Then one can do
  sort FOO-charnamelist us.klc us.klc | uniq -u > diff-FOO-charnamelist 
to see which characters are missing in the generated .klc files.

  (One supposes that .klc are generated by similar version of Perl, so line endings
   and encodings of FOO-charnamelist and us.klc match.)

(Essentially, I do it once, then run diff between the current .klc file and
one produced by an older version.  Since this is incremental, errors may creep
in; it makes sense to redo this time to time.
