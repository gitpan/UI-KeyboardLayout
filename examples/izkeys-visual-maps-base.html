<h1>izKeys layouts: visual diagrams</h1>

<p>The diagrams below illustrate the most basic ways to use the <b>izKeys</b> (<i>ee-zee-keys</i>) keyboard layout.
How to access the other keys?  The info may be extracted from the
table summaries of layout of the <a href=coverage-1prefix-Latin.html>Latin</a> and <a href=coverage-1prefix-Cyrillic.html>Cyrillic</a>
personalities (but these tables do not explicitly list the heuristics…).  For more information, see <a href=http://k.ilyaz.org/iz/windows>this</a> (you may also want to inspect 
the documentation of the toolset used to generate this layout:
<a href=http://search.cpan.org/~ilyaz/UI-KeyboardLayout-0.12/lib/UI/KeyboardLayout.pm>here</a>,
and <a href=http://search.cpan.org/~ilyaz/UI-KeyboardLayout-0.12/lib/UI/KeyboardLayout/izKeys.pod>here</a>, but they
are currently in a complete disarray).</p>

<p>Here, we completely ignore the questions how to enter math/IPA/UPA symbols (about a thousand is possible!), and exotic Latin
letters (more than a thousand of them) — let us just mention that the concepts/mneumonics helping one remember many of them 
are “mogrification rules”, <a href=#GreenRipe>“GreenKeys/RipeKeys” and “BlueKeys”</a>.  (The <i>reasons</i> for a character to appear on a 
particular key are listed in the mouse-popups when hovering on characters; these terms appear there.  See also the popups
for the column headers in <a href=coverage-1prefix-Latin.html>this table</a>.)
With the exception of the last section, what we discuss here is restricted to the most frequent Latin letters, as well as input of 
Cyrillic/Greek, and of Business symbols.</p>

<p>When a certain key or key combination is undefined, the keyboard produces the <i>visible bell</i> symbol <code><span class=vbell>♪</span></code>.
So one should not be surprised that this is the most frequent character in the diagrams below!
Remember that our keyboard layout are optimized for ease-of-remembering, not for ease-of-finger-movements.  (We completely
ignore the “base row” and other terms of mechanics of finger movement.  Anyway, it looks like “advantages” of keyboards optimized
for kinesthetic <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard#Controversy>might be exagerrated</a> anyway: 
at least, more or less objective research is inconclusive.)
</p>

<p>The diagrams are color-coded using outlines, character color, and character background.  Outlines relate to mnumonic rules;
<span class=very-special>green</span> and <span class=thinspecial><span class=special>blue</span></span> outlines indicate that either mneumonics are based on the position of
this character, or the characters are otherwise important, thus made easily guessable.  On the opposite end,
characters with <span class=need-learn>brown</span> <span class="need-learn on-right">outlines</span> are hopeless to guess using heuristics,
one must memorize them.  The key assignment of characters with <span class=may-guess>yellow</span> outlines cannot be guessed immediately, but there is 
an <i>approximate heuristic:</i> it assignes a few possible positions to the character, so one can quickly find the
needed key using 3–4 experiments; these heuristics are either explicitly mentioned, or related to sound/shape of character w.r.t. 
the Latin key it is put in.</p>

<p>We use <span style="background-color: gray;" class=not-surr>white outline</span> to indicate symbols
„ ‚“ ‘ ” ’« ‹ » ›‐ – — ― ‒ ‑〃 ‵ ‶ ‷ ′ ″ ‴ ⁗ ´ which were replaced by “surrogate” symbols in the typewriter age (more about this
<a href=#surr>below</a>).
In all diagrams, <span class=prefix>yellow characters</span>  denote prefix keys; other colors indicate visual bells, and 
<span class=on-right-ex>characters assigned to
<code>AltGr</code>-keys</span> (when many characters are displayed on the same key).  The meaning of background colors is the same as in <a href=coverage-1prefix-Latin.html>here</a> 
and <a href=coverage-1prefix-Cyrillic.html>here</a>.  <span class=three-cases>This frame</span> denotes
letters which have 3 case forms (lc/uc/titlecase); and <span class=three-cases-long>this frame</span> indicates that
the uppercase is encoded as two (or more) Unicode characters.  Sometimes the whole key also has a special background color;
this indicates that the positioning heuristic is “based on diagonals” — more details below.</p>

<p>Some prefix characters come in pairs; the secondary one acts as the primary combined with <code>AltGr</code>-inversion 
of the following keypress — so <code>PREFIX2 CHAR</code> acts as <code>PREFIX1 AltGr-CHAR</code>.  This is indicated by the
<span class="prefix prefix2">extra red outline</span> on a with-<code>Shift</code>-pair (or on the secondary prefix).
(See base Greek layouts for the examples.)</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> to show this page correctly, one may need to install extra fonts (<a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/">Deja vu</a>, 
<a href="http://junicode.sourceforge.net/">junicode</a>, <a href="http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/">Symbola</a>; unifont
has a very good coverage, but it also [as of 2011] has a special glyph inserted (explicitly — instead of using
<code>.notdef</code>!) for missing codepoints — and this
severely interacts with a choice of better fonts).  Some fonts have some glyphs wrong (I have seen
wrong directions of arrows, wrong choice of OXIA vs VARIA, or DASIA vs PSILI — especially on ρ).
Sometimes one should better zoom in (<code>Control-MouseWheel</code>, <code>Control-+</code>, or from menu; <code>Control-0</code> to return back) in browser to see details/differences of diacritic marks. </p>

<p>Note that each colored letter-diagonal contains exactly one vowel (outlined in blue); the diagonals guide the quick-access to the
¨,´,`-accented vowels (discussed in the next section).</p>

<p>Are the etched symbols on your keys very different?  Tough luck… — you will need to mentally rearrange the diagrams 
to suit your keyboard.  (Keyboard drivers access keyboards
basing on key scancodes, which <i>mostly</i> depend on the <i>position</i> of the key, not on what is drawn on it.)  The mneumonics used here
depend a lot on the etchings being as above. <b>Trivia:</b> ASCII encoding has SPACE and 94 other characters defined; this leads to 47 keys on the standard US keyboard
(2 characters per key).  The main variation in layout is the position of the <code>\|</code> key; sometimes
<code>Enter⏎</code>/<code>←Backspace</code>
keys have a different shape, and this key is moved about to compensate.  <b>Trivia:</b> the position of this key differed 
on the initial <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_keyboard>XT/AT/Enhanced keyboards</a>; apparently, keyboard
manufacturers think that this gives them a license to freely move it around…</p>

<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Mechanical_and_visual_layouts>ISO keyboards</a> have one “extra” key.  Above, it is the <i>other</i> key
<code>\|</code> (shown here to the left of <code>SPACE</code>).  Its position varies a lot between keyboards;
sometimes it is marked as <code>&lt; &gt;</code>; sometimes it is positioned to the left
of <code>Z</code>; on many US keyboards it is omitted altogether.  These
variations in position and markup do not matter — if the key is present, it behaves
as indicated; we do not put “important” characters at this position.  Likewise,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_alphabet#Keyboard_layout">Brazilian ABNT</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Japanese">Japanese JIS</a> keyboards have
yet another key on alphanumeric rows: on ABNT it is next to the right <code>Shift</code>, on JIS next to <code>Backspace</code>.
(Our diagrams do not show this key at all; for this layout, we do not plan to use it other than as <code>Compose</code> key.)</p>

<h1>Base Latin layout when <code>AltGr</code> is pressed </h1>

<p>All accented letters in this diagram
are also available on easier-to-remember multi-key sequences (starting with <span class=prefix>prefix</span> keys);
so remembering positions of the most of characters in this diagram is not <i>required</i>:
they are needed only to speed up the typing.</p>

<p><a name=surr></a>Pay attention to the difference between <i>letters</i>
and <i>symbols</i> — we call them <i>characters</i> when we do not care about the distinction.
“Letters” are parts of words; all the other characters are “symbols”.  Symbols with <span style="background-color: gray;" class=not-surr>white</span> outlines denote “no-nonsense variants”
of surrogate typewriter symbols <code>"</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>`</code>, <code>-</code> etc. (<b>Trivia:</b> With invention of typewriters,
many [tens?] of different symbols where jammed into one “surrogate” symbol to economize on the number of keyboard's keys; 
essentially, surrogates make no sense standalone.  For decades. we were forced to use surrogates and deduce
what was actually meant basing on context; nowadays, we can do better; see <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash>-This-</a>,
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English_usage_of_quotation_marks>“this”</a>,
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_%28symbol%29>this′</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark>this ″</a>,
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic>`that´</a>,
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Typographic_form>‘that’</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character>T H A T</a>.)</p>

</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>For this particular diagram: characters with green or blue outline are those for which people can immediately guess their position on
keyboard.  Since easily-guessable,
these positions are a very valuable property, and are “set in stone” — they win in conflicts with other positioning heuristics.
(Possible exceptions on guessability are ºª§; but if you saw the diagram above once, you have a good chance to guess them anyway. 
Euro € is at the position which is etched on many keyboards nowaday 
(compare with <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5981>this discussion</a>).</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> in earlier versions of this keyboard, <code>·</code> and <code>§</code> were on 7/&amp; key; then I 
discovered <a href=http://www.mrmartinweb.com/type.htm#blickensderfer>Blickensderfer No. 5 (1896)</a>….
This was <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution>convergence</a> in action!  (But now I think that
√ is much too similar to 7 to miss an opportunity….)</p>

<p>On the opposite end of the guessability scale are letters with brown outlines: they take ad hoc positions which must be
memorized.  In between on the guessability scale are letters on the colored diagonals (two ⤡-diagonal on the left-hand side, and
four ⤢-diagonals on the right-hand side) — they may be calculated using a simple rule.  Each colored diagonal has one vowel
on the “base” layer, and  three ¨,´,`-accented variants of this vowel are put on 3 keys on the diagonal — from top to bottom.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b> observe the red diagonal on the right with ü/ú/ù.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this diagonal is the only “clean” example: the other diagonals contain letters which are “set in stone”,
so the by-diagonal rule loses.  When a very important letter loses in playing chicken, it yellows (look for yellow outlines) and
is “bumped away” one position <i>across</i> the diagonal (preferably down, if possible).  (Observe the red arrows!)  The extremely rare letters <code>ë</code>,
<code>ỳ</code> and <code>ï</code> are just discarded; the more frequent <code>ì</code> withers and becomes brown-outlined.</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b> How to type Blue/Green outlined characters may be guessed immediately.  For no-outline characters on colored
diagonals there is a very simple rule to locate them.  If one <i>also</i> remembers the “bumped away” rule, one
can locate 4 letters with yellow outlines.  If one wants to quick-type the remaining 3 brown-outline letters (and no-outline symbols),
one must memorize them.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> <i>Did you notice <code>ẞ</code> = upper-cased <code>ß</code>?</i> (These are different letters!) 
<a href=http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2007-m05/0008.html>Unicode has many wonders</a>... (this link leads to an
<i>extremely <a href=http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2007-m05/0148.html>long</a></i> thread!).
Why <code>ê</code> is blue?  It is the only set-in-stone accented vowel...</p>

<p><b>A remark on prefix key.</b> The color on the diagram indicates that pressing <code>AltGr-$</code> produces a prefix key.
It also shows that this prefix key is <i>denoted</i> as <code>£</code>; but keep in mind that <i>using the symbol £ here is just 
a notational convention</i>!</p>

<p>By itself, a prefix key does not make any sense.  What is important to know is how to describe succintly the semantic of “what
it does with the following letter/symbol/etc”; one may ask what happens when it is followed by space; and one may ask what
happens when it is pressed twice.  The answers are: it finds business-symbol/currency-symbol which matches best the given letter,
or modifies the symbol by adding a vertical line; it produces <code>␠</code>; it produces <code>£</code>.  Hence the notation
above is quite appropriate.</p>

<p>In general, the prefix keys of this layout try to do likewise: when we <i>denote</i> a prefix key by a certain diacritic
mark, we want: prefix + a letter (or <code>AltGr-letter</code>) produces the letter+diacritic with the diacritic as close
to “this notation” as possible; prefix + a symbol mogrifies the symbol in a way similar to the name of the diacritic
(say, <code>acute</code> may make “with sharper corners” version of the symbol, and <code>ring-above</code> may produce a “rounded”
version); following it by <code>SPACE</code> produces the standalone diacritic character; and typing it twice produces the
corresponding combining character.  (Moreover, one can produce more standalone variants by modifying <code>SPACE</code> 
by <code>Shift</code> or <code>AltGr</code>; one can get more combining variants by prefix + <code>'</code> — and one can
use <code>Shift</code>/<code>AltGr</code> on <code>Shift</code> or <code>'</code>.)</p>

<h1>Base Cyrillic layout</h1>

<p>The base layout of Cyrillic personality follows the only phonetic layout which has a remote chance to be called 
“standard” — one from X11.
Letters with brown outline must be memorized.  Positions of letters with green outline can be guessed
with two tries (but if forgotten, they may lead to a [quickly going away] confusion):</p>

<div class="klayout uclc do-alt" kbd_rebuild="/opt=cyr +base=l,,0 +=c,,0">
			/* To be auto-generated */
</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>The most important <i>other</i> thing to remember is that if a letter (say, <code>Ю</code>) replaces ASCII
symbols (such as <code>`</code> and <code>~</code>), the symbols are available via combination with <code>AltGr</code>.
And <code>Ъ</code>/<code>Ё</code> are available <i>also</i> by combining <code>AltGr</code> with <code>Ь</code>/<code>Е</code>.
(Compare with <code>AltGr</code>-combined diagram below, after the next diagram.)</p>

<p><a name=ripeEx></a>Base Cyrillic layout as visible from Latin personality after <code>AltGr-Space</code> (so 
<a href=#GreenRipe>“RipeKeys”</a> replace shared
symbols; colors as in the previous diagram).  </p>

<div class="klayout uclc do-alt" kbd_rebuild="/opt=cyr +base=l,,0 +=l,ƒ,0">
			/* To be auto-generated */
</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<h1><code>AltGr</code> Cyrillic layout</h1>

<p>In <code>izKeys</code> layout, the cyrillic letters are <i>prioritized</i> into classes; the higher the priority, the easier is the
letter to key in.  In the top priority class are modern Russian letters; one can enter them using only the <code>Shift</code>
modifier.  The second-class citizens may be keyed in using an extra <code>AltGr</code>-modifier.  For third-class citizens, 
one uses the <code>AltGr-'</code> prefix; for the fourth-class citizens, the key after this prefix requires <code>AltGr</code>-modifier.
Finally, there are certain “exotics”; they are entered with <code>AltGr-^</code> prefix (possibly with <code>AltGr</code>-modifier
on the next keypress).</p>

<p>One of the ideas of the <code>izKeys</code> layout is that when the “priority class” of a letter is known, one should be able 
to immediate guess
on which key this letter is present.  (There are exceptions, but they are in a very narrow minority.)  What remains is
knowing how the priority is assigned to letters; this is explained near the diagram of every class.</p>

<p>Here is the base Cyrillic face (essentially, consisting of Russian letters) with
<code>AltGr</code>-bindings added in red.  These second-class citizens are from the modern Slavic Cyrillic-based languages, 
XIX century Russian, and Kazakh:

<div class="klayout uclc do-alt alt2 base-center large-base" kbd_rebuild="/opt=cyr +base=l,,0 on-right+=c,,1 on-left+=c,,0">
			/* To be auto-generated */
</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>Color codes are as above; positions of the letters Ѣ,Є,Ә are artificial,
but still may be guessed on the third try, while positions of Ѓ and Ј must be memorized (heuristics:
Ѓ overflows down from Г=G; the position of Ј “<i>is questionable</i>”.  For the rest of the letters,
if one knows that they <i>are indeed</i> prioritized to be on <code>AltGr</code>-bindings, one can immediately guess
on which key.  (And to know this is simple: all of the characters described above are present, except for
Kazakh Ғ Ң Ө Ү Ұ [available on “extras” Cyrillic layout — with Ғ overflowing left to F, and Ұ requiring <code>AltGr</code>]; 
the only other characters present are Ԗ Ѡ Ѱ and PALOCHKA Ӏ.)</p>

<p>Prefix keys are in yellow.  In addition to £ (which is Business-prefix=<code>AltGr-$</code> — same as on Latin face), two
Cyrillic-specific prefix keys are: <code>AltGr-'</code> introduces “extra” Cyrillic letters
(and fractions), and <code>AltGr-^</code> introduces titlo-forms and “exotic” Cyrillic characters.  
As usual, pressing the prefix twice produces the corresponding combining character: the stress mark and titlo.

<h1>The “prefixed” Cyrillic layouts</h1>

The “extras” Cyrillic layout (the prefix is <code>AltGr-'</code> in Cyrillic personality; double-<code>AltGr-SPACE</code>
in Latin):</p>

<div class="klayout uclc do-alt alt2 base-center large-base" kbd_rebuild="/opt=cyr,cyr2 +base=l,,0 on-right+=c,◌́,1 on-left+=c,◌́,0">
			/* To be auto-generated */
</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>Letters with yellow overline are not in the most obvious positions, but at least there is some hope to remember some heuristics. 
This includes ҼҾ (Abkhazian CHEs) and ҒӺ (stroked GHE's) which “slided to the left” from Ч and Г, and Komi Ԋ on comma [;-].</p>

<p>This face contains the “leftover” characters of ISO 8859-5, Church Slavonic (except
letters-titlo-form and powers-of-10), and the characters in flavors of ru on X11 (Kazakh,
Tatar, Ossetian, Chuvash, Udmurt, Komi, Yakut, Kalmyk, Bashkirian, Mari).  The iotized
letters are of decreased priority; yet more penalized are latinized, with-diaresis, hooked,
and stroked variants.  (Of two letters competing for the same position, the more penalized
one becomes red.)
</p>

<p>The rules to enter fractions are very simple: <code>AltGr-' DIGIT</code> enters a fraction with
the digit in denominator; <code>AltGr-' Shift-DIGIT</code> does the same for numerator.  If another
precomposed fraction with the same denominator/numerator is available in Unicode, add <code>AltGr</code>
modifier to access the other fraction.  <b>Example:</b> there are four fractions with denominator 8: ⅛, ⅜, ⅝, ⅞
(in order of numerators).  Now <code>AltGr-' 8</code> accesses the first one, ⅛; pressing <code>AltGr-' AltGr-8</code>
accesses the second one, ⅜.  All precomposed fractions can be entered this way (<b>Example:</b> ⅝, ⅞ may be entered via
digit-in-numerator <code>AltGr-' AltGr-%</code> and <code>AltGr-' &amp;</code>).  <b>Trivia:</b> there is another way to enter Unicode fractions: use superscript digits for the
numerator, subscript digits for the denominator, and separate them by FRACTION SLASH available via GreenKey <code>Shift-SPACE /</code> 
(as well as on <code>AltGr-/ SPACE</code>) to get something like ¹²⁄₃₅ (the very narrow “bounding box” of FRACTION SLASH ensures the nice look).</p>

<p>Titlo-forms, power-of-10 multipliers, and “exotics” (the prefix is <code>AltGr-^</code> in Cyrillic personality; triple-<code>AltGr-SPACE</code>
in Latin):</p>


<div class="klayout uclc do-alt alt2 base-center large-base thinspecial" kbd_rebuild="/opt=cyr,keepO,cyr3 +base=l,,0 on-right+=c,0483,1 on-left+=c,0483,0">
			/* To be auto-generated */
</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>Note the <code>Shift</code>-trick: since titlo-forms
are not available in upper-case, we hijack the <code>Shift</code>-position and put the titlo-form of an “extra” letter 
(one on <code>AltGr-' LTR</code>)
to <code>AltGr-^ Shift-LTR</code>; see keys <code>Ю</code> and <code>Я</code> above.
Also, note exceptions: ◌ⷵ on S, titlo-Ꙉ (djerv) ◌ⷸ on D, ᴫ (small capital л) on L, and ᵸ on N (which is a “modifier letter”, not a
“combining letter”).  Power-of-10 
multipliers are available on the corresponding digit keys 3...8.  (<b>Trivia:</b> all multipliers but “thousands” ҂ are combining.)  
Ocular О's ꙨꙪꙬꙮ are on digits 1...3 according to their multiplicity (with or without <code>AltGr</code>; note that here 3
means “many” ;-). In addition to these exceptions, yellow outlines are
on heuristically good ZEMLYA/DZELO Ꙁ/Ꙃ on 0, Ҹ which “slided left”, and Komi letters NJE/ZJE/DZJE on comma ;-) (here — and on the “extra” layer). </p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> Many paleo-Slavonic “exotics” were championed into Unicode by Balkan scholars; it is not surprising 
that the approach of these scholars was different from what was traditional for East and North Slavic studies.  Nowadays there is
a hope to get a consensus on how to transcribe North Slavic manuscripts into Unicode; see
<a href=http://www.synaxis.info/azbuka/ponomar/charset/charset_1.htm>this proposal</a>, its
<a href=http://www.synaxis.info/azbuka/ponomar/charset/charset_2.htm>part II</a>, and <a href=http://www.ponomar.net/cu_support.html>this
page</a>.  (There is widespread misunderstanding of how to use еЕ/єЄ for paleo-Slavonic: these are for ”есть узкий/широкий”.)</p>

<h1>Base Greek layout + monotonic + polytonic + Coptic</h1>

<p><a name=greenEx></a>Base Greek layout as visible from Latin Personality (on GREEN=<code>Shift-SPACE</code> prefix, so 
<a href=#GreenRipe>GreenKeys</a> replace symbols):</p>

<div class="klayout uclc do-alt diag" kbd_rebuild="/opt=0 +base=l,,0 +=l,ĸ,0">
			/* To be auto-generated */
</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>Positions of Greek letters with brown outline must be memorized (heuristics: θ and Q are both O with an extra stroke; y is one half of ψ).  The rest of base letters is guessable: either phonetically,
or, if conflicts appear, visually (the base letters coincide with <a href="http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyboarddownloads/%7B4D179548-1215-4167-8EF7-7F42B9B0C2A6%7D/manual.pdf">the
Galaxy layout</a>; the mixup of <code>χ/Χ</code> (chi; on <code>x</code>) and <code>ξ/Ξ</code> (xi; on <code>c</code>) is unfortunate, but it is shared by many other
layouts).  Two green-outline letters pre-combined with diaeresis must also be memorized if one wants to enter
monotonic Greek; <code>;</code> and <code>?</code> give the Greek flavors (<b>Trivia:</b> the latter is deprecated — use the Latin <code>;</code>
instead). </p>

<p>Polytonic Greek is produced with 3 prefix keys <code>\</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>.
Pay attention to vowels (blue outline) above, one on every color-tinted diagonal; compare with this <code>GREEK [</code> layout
(with <code>AltGr</code>-bindings added in red):</p>

<div class="klayout uclc do-alt alt2 base-center large-base diag no-doubleaccent" kbd_rebuild="/opt=0 +base=l,,0 on-right+=l,0314,1 on-left+=l,0314,0">

</div>  <!-- Cannot match the width of the bottom row exactly — probably due to rounding to 1px??? -->

<p>(For a moment, ignore the key <code>3#</code>.) Observe that all characters have aspiration ῾ (visually similar to <code>[</code>),
that the other accents depend on the row and color (black or red), and the base letter depends on the (colored) diagonal.</p>

<p><b>The rule:</b> Prefix <code>\</code> with a key on a diagonal of a vowel
produces the accented vowel: the row determines the accent: 
the top letter row gives the polytonic variant ´ of acute accent (OXIA), the low letter row gives the grave accent ` (VARIA),
and the number row gives the circumflex accent ῀ (PERISPOMENI).   The middle letter
row gives none (of these 3 accents).  Combine the letter with <code>AltGr</code> to obtain the combinations with diaeresis
(DIALYTIKA; applicable only to ι/Ι and υ/Υ) or iotization (YPOGEGRAMMENI=ͺ or PROSGEGRAMMENI=ι — on lower/upper case).  To combine with aspiration, replace
<code>\</code> by one of <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> — depending on the shape of aspiration accent: ῾ (DASIA) and ᾿ (PSILI).  
Rho ρ/Ρ takes aspiration signs as if it were a vowel; the corresponding “diagonal” contains the only key <code>`</code>.</p>

<b>Example:</b> <code>GREEK [ AltGr-@</code> produces ᾯ (here <code>GREEK</code> is GREEN=<code>Shift-SPACE</code>).
And here is why: <code>@</code> is <code>Shift-2</code>; due to <code>Shift</code>, the result is in <i>uppercase</i>; 
the key with <code>2</code> and
<code>@</code> is on the green diagonal which contains the vowel ω/Ω; hence one gets an accented Ω. It is iotized (note ι-like diacritic below) since <code>@</code> was combined with <code>AltGr</code>;
the key with <code>2</code> and <code>@</code> is on the number row, which adds the circumflex (and in Greek it looks like <code>~</code>);
finally, since we used <code>[</code> “instead of” <code>\</code>, this adds the aspiration ῾ (DASIA) looking like <code>[</code>.

<p>Observe the red symbols on the rightmost red diagonal: they
are <i>standalone</i> polytonic diacritics!  (The diagram above is as seen from Latin personality; from Cyrillic one there are usual complications related to 
many ways to produce ёЁъЪ — for example, the key <code>#</code> does not
access number-symbol ͵ as it does from the Latin personality.)</p>

<p><b>Summary for standalone:</b> to enter a standalone polytonic diacritic, pretend that you 
put it on (non-existent) OMICRON-DIALYTIKA (in other words, the last key in the sequence should be <code>AltGr-</code> on
a key in the rightmost red diagonal — the diagonal of <code>.</code> DOT).  What to do with DIALYTIKA/YPOGEGRAMMENI/PROSGEGRAMMENI which would require a <i>“second”</i> 
<code>AltGr</code> modifier?  Replace it by <code>Shift</code>!  (Exceptions: removing this <code>Shift</code> converts
the standalone PROSGEGRAMMENI to (surprise!) YPOGEGRAMMENI; and <code>Shift</code> converts PSILI to CORONIS.  There are
other ways to get combinations like DIALYTIKA AND VARIA: for example, by adding GRAVE to DIAERESIS via 
<code>AltGr-` AltGr-;</code>.  <b>Trivia:</b> Note also that there is no standalone DIALYTIKA symbol; use the standalone ¨ DIAERESIS via
<code>AltGr-; SPACE</code> instead.)</p>

<p><b>Numeral signs</b> are accessible on keys <code>3</code> and <code>#</code>.  On the prefix <code>/</code>
they are “as expected”: <code>3</code> gives the lower one, and <code>#</code> the “normal” one (duplicated on the prefix <code>]</code>).  
(On the prefix <code>[</code> this pair is inverted, to fight with ъЪёЁ-confusion in access from the Cyrillic personality.)
To join them, <i>standalone monotonic</i> diacritics ΄,΅ are available on <code>AltGr-3</code> and <code>AltGr-#</code>.</p>

<p><b>Macron and breve:</b> Observe that by the rules above, <code>GREEK \ LTR</code> with <code>LTR</code> from
the middle letter row would produce an unaccented vowel.  To avoid waste, they instead produce either a vowel with breve (VRACHY)
or with macron (vowels α/υ/ι may take them — the other vowels already have separate forms for shorter/longer variants),
or LUNATE variant symbol ϵ for ε (on <code>d</code>).  To get breve, proceed as if
you want to get unaccented vowel; to get macron, do the same on the next key to the right or left (so a/j/k 
produce ᾰ/ῠ/ῐ, s/h/l produce ᾱ/ῡ/ῑ, and d makes ϵ).  To clarify, here is the diagram of <code>GREEK \</code>
(observe also Zodiak symbols on <code>Shift-NUMBERS</code> row):</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiak#The_twelve_signs>Numeration of Zodiak constellations</a> starts on 
the spring equinox; so the first 20 days of <code>N</code>th month is in
the Zodiak sign number <code>N-3</code> or <code>N+9</code>.  We put 10th,11th,12th signs on keys <code>0 )</code>, <code>- _</code>
and <code>= +</code>; to get 13 for the price of 12, the sign ⛎ (for the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus#Ophiuchus_and_the_zodiac>not-Zodiacal</a> but ecliptical constallation
Ophiuchus) is put on <code>~</code>.</p>

<p>Monotonic and “special” Greek letters can be accessed on the base face by combining with <code>AltGr</code>.  On vowels, this adds
tonos ΄ (acute accent).  On consonants, it produces special forms (final, scientific etc) and archaic letters.

<p>Observe kai ϗ — this is one of exceptional cases when a lower-case letter is put in a <code>Shift</code>ed position.
(As a case pair, kai is available via the “Coptic prefix” <code>`</code>.)  Note also that red letters with yellow outline
are guessable by simple heuristics (“one of the sounds” for stigma Ϛ, visual for the rest).  (Moreover, digamma Ϝ is “on top of”
Ψ which “is a di-Y”, and we use ϔ as “the shifted variant” of ΰ.)</p>

<p>The prefix key <code>`</code> allows one to enter Coptic (and multitude of others Greek-related symbols).</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> Latin variants
of names of Coptic letters are not standartized; so we use 3 names: Unicode name in capital, and two lowercase names
from Wikipedia pages: of 2012/08 and of 2012/01.  Since important for finding the positions, the remaining ones are:
SHEI/shy/šai ϣ, HORI/hoori/hori ϩ.  (To simplify memorization, SAMPI/<b>none</b>/psis nše Ⳁ is also made available

<p>Observe that all of <code>©®℠™℗</code> “Business” signs are in the obvious locations; so are Vietnamese ơ and ư (heuristic:
the $ sign has a hook on top right).  All the currency signs of Unicode 6.2 can be entered by the first
letter of their name or the country name (but one may need to combine with <code>Shift</code> or <code>AltGr</code>).
Exceptions are YUAN[s],RIEL,RIAL,LIVRE TOURNOIS which are entered by the second letter.  (<b>Trivia:</b> there are 3 signs for YEN (one latin,
and 2 ideographic), and 2 (ideographic) signs for YUAN.)  The “principal” sign for both of them is available on <code>y/Y</code>;
the remaining 2 signs for YEN are on <code>AltGr-y/Y</code>, and both signs for YUAN are on <code>AltGr-u/U</code>.
The remaining exceptions are the common currency symbols recognized by the shape, such as <code>$</code>

<p>Note that zero-vowel Latin letters (schwa) are positioned on <code>Z</code>.  This convention (considering <code>Z</code> and
<code>0</code> as siblings) also influences other decisions made in design of this keyboard.  <b>Trivia:</b> Do not confuse these <i>Latin
letters</i> between themselves (Azeri əƏ vs. African ǝƎ), or with similarly-shaped <i>Cyrillic letter</i> әӘ, or with IPA <i>symbol</i>
ə for schwa, or with <code>THERE EXISTS</code> <i>math symbol</i> ∃.  As a minimum, they sort differently, have different capitalization
rules, and their surrounding may be typeset differently by a smart enough typesetter.  Similarity (or even identity) of glyphs has
very little relationship to “sameness” of Unicode characters.</p>

<p><b>CONSONANTS</b> are at the corresponding phonetic <code>QWERTY</code> lower-case positions, except for 
HET ח on <code>H</code> (or slided right to <code>j</code>)
and visually placed SHIN ש on <code>w</code> and TET ט on <code>u/T</code>.
(<b>Trivia:</b> two other “QWERTY” layouts, <a href=http://bc.tech.coop/Hebrew-ZC.html>ZC</a> and
<a href=http://dougshivers.com/mikhtav/osx.html>Script</a>, place consonants the same as our — with exceptions of TET and VAV 
(one on <code>v</code>) — and they mismatch at these positions.)  If a final form exists, it is put on
<code>Shift</code>-position; likewise for SIN/SHIN variants (with the corresponding combining dot put in 
<code>AltGr</code>-position).  DAGESH/MAPIQ/SHURUQ must be memorized on <code>Y</code>.
(Additionally, HOLAM FOR VAV is on <code>AltGr-v</code>.)</p>

<p><b>The Yiddish digraphs</b> are on <code>AltGr-Shift</code> of the suitable key.  <b>Trivia:</b> Only one of them, ײַ, cannot
be entered using Hebrew letters; it is put on more accessible <code>AltGr-y</code>.  The only other non-Hebrew sign,
JUDEO-SPANISH VARIKA is on <code>AltGr-j</code>.  Dotted versions of <bdo dir=ltr>BET בּ, KAF כּ/ךּ, PE פּ/ףּ</bdo> may be entered 
with <code>AltGr</code> (on the left-hand key, if the base letter is on two keys).</p>

<p><b>VOWELS (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud>niqqud</a>)</b> are positioned phonetically (and according to their — vestigal — <a 
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet#Comparison_table>duration</a>) on keys with the blue outlines.  
<b>Trivia:</b> there are up to 5 durations per sound, ordered in decreasing order: one may consider SHEVA ◌ְ as the 4th form 
of <code>e</code>, and <code>o</code> has 4 or 5 forms, 
<bdo dir=ltr>וֹ, ◌ֹ, ◌ָ/<a href=http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2004-m05/0234.html>◌ׇ</a>, ◌ֳ</bdo>.</p>

<p>The first 3 niqqud are put on <code>Shift/AltGr/Shift-AltGr</code>-vowel.  The remaining (up to 2) are put on
<code>AltGr/Shift-AltGr</code> of the key below the vowel.
So in the diagram above, it is the longest form which is visible on the <code>Shift-vowel</code> (except for <code>i</code>
for which we cover one duration ◌ִ only; it is יִ which is put on <code>AltGr-i</code>).</p>

<p><b>SLIDED VOWELS:</b> In addition to its <code>AltGr</code>-position, the secondary vowel point is <i>also</i> put on
<code>Shifted</code> key <i>below</i> the vowel (observe the colored groups of
keys above).  The <i>shva</i>-form of the vowel is (in addition to its <code>Shift-AltGr</code>-position) on the key <i>above</i> 
(or, if not possible, <i>right</i>).  
<b>Trivia:</b> For <code>o</code>, one can go neither above nor right.  One tertiary form is already on <code>A</code> (the ambiguous one); the
disambiguation form can be entered without <code>AltGr</code> only on keyboards with an ISO key.</p>

<p>Likewise, we slide SHEVA yet more down of <code>e</code> — to <code>V</code>.
Except for RAFE, SHIN/SIN DOTS, <a href=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2755.pdf>QAMATS QATAN</a> and HATAF QAMATS, all 
niqqud may be entered on <code>Shift-letters</code>.  (Since <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud#Demonstration>RAFE may
be quite frequent in certain contexts</a>, RAFE and QAMATS QATAN are made available on the

<p><b><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantillation>CANTILLATION MARKS</a></b> are positioned visually (green outline on 
symbol keys), or according to the first letter of Unicode name (blue outline) or the 1st-letter-of-the-2nd-word (green outline 
on letter keys; also on SHALSHELET — which is put based on the 1st Hebrew letter, SHIN).  If there is no more space for the mark,
the mark migrates along an arrow to the neighbor key (and gets a brown outline; only for GERESH and variants of 
<code>&lt;,~</code>).  <b>Trivia:</b> the <i>Unicode</i> names are 
<a href=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/hr/unicode.htm>mis-transliterated</a>.</p>

<p><b>DIAL-NIQQUD-BY-NUMBER:</b> On <code>AltGr</code>-digits, the niqqud is put “visually”, according to its “number of dots”.  
Here we count in binary: <code>T</code> of ◌ָ is counted as if it were
˙ ⁚ ˙; we count — of ◌ַ as merged 8 dots.  (And ⋱ is counted as a diagonal in a 3×3 square, giving 9. ;-)  Now note that 10
points of —: land it on 0, and that shva of SHEVA is counted both as a <code>Shift</code>-variant of 2 dots, and — visually — as
<code>=</code>.  (And <code>T</code> of ◌ׇ counted as 7 is just an exception.)</p>

<p><b>Annotation marks</b> ◌ׅ, ◌֯, ◌ׄ also have brown outlines (on <code>?cC</code>).  <b>Punctuation</b> is not specially 
highlighted (since <i>the rest</i> is drawn with ◌).  All Hebrew cantillation marks, punctuation and annotation marks are 
present; those without outlines are duplicates — at more or less random positions.  The reorder-control invisible characters are on

<p>Below is a combined diagram of this layout with <code>AltGr</code>-bindings added in red.</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> note that Unicode <i>names</i> for characters <code>([{}])</code> start with <code>LEFT/RIGHT</code>, but the Unicode 
defines their <i>semantic</i> (in BiDi context) to be <code>OPEN/CLOSE</code> instead.  In particular, when in Right-to-Left
context, the <code>CLOSE</code> characters mutates their shape to <code>([{</code>, likewise for <code>OPEN</code> to 
<code>}])</code>.  This is called 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_of_Unicode_characters#Bidirectional_Neutral_Formatting>BiDi mirroring</a>.
A similar effect happens with <code>&lt; &gt;</code>, but at least this reflect the names <code>LESS/GREATER THAN</code>
of these characters.</p>

<p><i>This</i> layout follows the “logical” approach, not the “visual” approach: pressing <code>Shift-9</code>
enters the <code>OPENING PARENTHESIS</code>, not the “character which looks like <code>(</code> in Hebrew text”; likewise
for other mirroring characters.  So to type “(WORD)” one types <code>Shift-9 W O R D Shift-0</code> no matter whether 
<code>WORD</code> is in left-to-right or right-to-left script.  Similarly, <code>Shift-,</code> produces <code>LESS THAN</code>,
and not the character which looks like <code>&lt;</code> in right-to-left context.</p>

<h1><code>Green/Ripe</code> access and <code>BlueKeys</code></h1>

<p>In additition to its <i>satellite</i> faces (such as diacritic faces of Latin personality, or “extras” and “bizzare”
Cyrillic faces, or polytonic/Coptic for Greek), each personality has bridges to the other 3 scripts.  These bridges 
are intended for a quick entering of individual characters from another script; to enter a stretch of text in another
script, it makes much more sense to switch to the personality of this script (how such switching happens is OS-specific).
(For very short stretches, one may also consider the convenience access via the <code>Application-Menu</code> modifier; 
see below.)</p>

<p>The prefix keys enabling the bridging are codenamed <code>Green</code> and <code>Ripe</code>: they are <code>Shift-SPACE</code>
and <code>AltGr-SPACE</code> (also mneumonic as Left/Right).  Pressing these prefixes repeatedly accesses also the “convenience 
faces” (MathBlue, Business, negation etc).  The personalities are ordered as Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and the prefixes
<code>Green</code>, <code>Ripe</code> and <code>Ripe×2</code> accesses 3 other personalities in this order.</p>

<p>Repeated <code>Green</code> accesses: (×2) MathBlue, (×3) Business, (×4) Coptic.  ×3-Repeated <code>Ripe</code>
accesses the “extras” <code>Cyrillic'</code>-face.  As an added convenience, the base layer of the <code>Green</code> face is also 
accessible via combining keyspresses with <code>Application-Menu</code> modifier key (this enters base Latin or base Greek).</p>

<p>On symbol positions, the <code>Green</code> and <code>Ripe</code> faces differ from the scripts personality's faces: the
keys identical to the current script's keys (automatically non-alphabetical!) are replaced by special <code>GreenKeys</code> and 
<code>RipeKeys</code>.  This provides a quick way to enter special symbols.</p>  

<p>Another way to access special symbols is via
<code>BlueKeys</code> (available on <code>2×Green</code>).  The principal difference between <code>BlueKeys</code> and the
<code>Green/RipeKeys</code> is that <code>BlueKeys</code> are <i>also</i> sources for mogrification: for example, when <i>macron</i> mogrifier prefix is 
followed by <code>&amp;</code> key, it cannot produce any reasonable result; so in addition to trying to mogrify <code>&amp;</code>, it also
tries to mogrify the corresponding <code>BlueKey</code>, which is <code>∩</code>, producing <code>⩃</code> (the alternative
way <code>⩍</code> to combine horizontal line with ∩ is available on <i>macron</i> + <code>AltGr-&amp;</code>).
</p>

<p>So the symbols which may be subject to extensive mogrification are put on <code>BlueKeys</code>; the “unique” symbols
which won't be useful as sources for mogrification are put on <code>GreenKeys</code> and <code>RipeKeys</code>.  The
heuristic for distinction between <code>GreenKeys</code> and <code>RipeKeys</code> is that <code>GreenKeys</code> 
are more “mathematical” when <code>RipeKeys</code> are more “typographical”; for an example, consider <code>·</code> and 
<code>…</code> competing for the “<code>.</code>” position.</p>

<p>See <a href=#greenEx>example of <code>GreenKeys</code></a>, <a href=#ripeEx>of <code>RipeKeys</code></a>.
Below is the <code>MathBlue</code> face (which combines <code>BlueKeys</code> and math letters) as visible from Latin personality:</p>

<p><b>Trivia:</b> Note the difference between Hebrew-letter mathematical symbols (ℵ], (ℶ], (ℷ], (ℸ] and the Hebrew letters 
(א], (ב], (ג], (ד].  As a minimum, 
they are typeset in different directions (in this file, they are entered in the order (aleph]/(beth]/(gimel]/(dalet] and are
surrounded by open-round/close-square parentheses); then this change of direction affects the symbols surrounding them (the
parentheses in between Hebrew letters are 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_of_Unicode_characters#Bidirectional_Neutral_Formatting>mirrored, commas in between 
are typeset in the right-to-left order</a>); and then 
most probably the application will take them from different fonts — and even if taken from the same font, they may have very 
different shapes/sizes since symbols are made look good when surrounded by Latin characters.  Another comparison: ℵ₀, ℵ₁ vs.
א₀ א₁.</p>
